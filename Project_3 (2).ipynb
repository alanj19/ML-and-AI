    "Our analysis showed that age and estimated salary are the strongest predictors of whether a customer will purchase a cog, with middle-aged and higher-income customers being the most likely buyers. The gender distribution in the dataset was well-balanced, meaning the model was not influenced by gender bias in its predictions. After cleaning the data, correcting mislabeled entries, and balancing the classes, several models were tested — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Among them, Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with an accuracy between 0.53, making it the most reliable model for predicting customer purchase behavior. This model provides valuable insights that can help the sales team identify high-potential customers, target marketing efforts more effectively, and ultimately increase sales efficiency by focusing resources where purchases are most likely to occur. However, the accuracy is not up to par, so we would love to receive more data or even more features to see if we could boost the accuracy and best find how to increase sales."
